## Highlights

+ __Smart Fallback:__
If the target app isn't installed, TRAppBridge falls back to a web URL, ensuring a seamless user experience.

+ __Type-Safe API:__
Leverage Swift's type system for safer, more intuitive deep linking.

+ __Modular Design:__
Easily extend TRAppBridge to support new apps and actions.

## Features

```swift
let bridge = TRAppBridge.shared

// Open Facebook app
bridge.open(.facebook) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        print("Facebook app opened successfully")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Failed to open Facebook app: \(error)")
    }
}

// Open a specific Facebook profile
bridge.open(.facebook(.profile("username"))) { result in
    // Handle result
}
```

2. Build and run the TRAppBridgeExample scheme.

For more details, see the Example Project README.

## Motivation

Deep linking between apps can be challenging and error-prone. TRAppBridge aims to simplify this process, providing a type-safe, easy-to-use API for iOS developers. By centralizing deep linking logic and providing a consistent interface, TRAppBridge reduces the potential for errors and improves code maintainability.
